# PythonSecureCounter
A Python class called SecureCounter that securely manages counter values ​​and can be used in a multi-threaded environment. A Python class called SecureCounter that implements same functionality as previous version. Python uses categories instead of data structures. __init__ method is used to initialize class attributes and constructors. Use raise ValueError to handle error conditions, and return a Result type to represent error. Python does not return self explicitly like previous versions. SecureCounter class can be used in scenarios where counter values ​​need to be managed securely. Limit resource usage, limit number of accesses, and implement simple decentralized locking. In a multi-user system, it can be used to limit resource usage of each user, such as number of software licenses. In API or website services, it can be used to limit number of accesses per user or IP address to prevent abuse. In a distributed system, it can be used to implement simple distributed locking and control concurrent access to shared resources. SecureCounter class supports custom maximum and minimum values, which can be specified when creating a SecureCounter instance. In addition to basic counter function, kit currently does not provide other security features.

This implementation mainly includes following features: SecureCounter class encapsulates secure counter function and includes increment and decrement methods. Use threading.Lock to ensure thread safety when modifying counter values. Limits on maximum and minimum values ​​are provided, and a ValueError exception is thrown if range is exceeded. main function demonstrates situation where multiple threads access SecureCounter at same time.
