# PythonSecureCounter
A Python class called SecureCounter that securely manages counter values ​​and can be used in a multi-threaded environment. A Python class called SecureCounter that implements the same functionality as the previous version. Python uses categories instead of data structures. The __init__ method is used to initialize class attributes and constructors. Use raise ValueError to handle error conditions, and return a Result type to represent the error. Python does not return self explicitly like previous versions. The SecureCounter class can be used in scenarios where counter values ​​need to be managed securely. Limit resource usage, limit the number of accesses, and implement simple decentralized locking. In a multi-user system, it can be used to limit the resource usage of each user, such as the number of software licenses. In API or website services, it can be used to limit the number of accesses per user or IP address to prevent abuse. In a distributed system, it can be used to implement simple distributed locking and control concurrent access to shared resources. The SecureCounter class supports custom maximum and minimum values, which can be specified when creating a SecureCounter instance. In addition to the basic counter function, the kit currently does not provide other security features.

This implementation mainly includes the following features: The SecureCounter class encapsulates the secure counter function and includes increment and decrement methods. Use threading.Lock to ensure thread safety when modifying counter values. Limits on the maximum and minimum values ​​are provided, and a ValueError exception is thrown if the range is exceeded. The main function demonstrates the situation where multiple threads access SecureCounter at the same time.
